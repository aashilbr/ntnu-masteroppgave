# Devcontainer

Devcontainer is helpful for managing all dev dependencies. The interwebz have more information about devcontainers if you're not familiar with them :)

With VS Code, you can install the Remote-Containers extension, and then "Open folder in in Container".

## PyMesh

This module uses PyMesh. We compile PyMesh from source. Be aware that you need approximately 12GB of RAM to compile PyMesh.
